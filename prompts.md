## init

I want to develop a plugin for Obsidian with the following requirements:

- it shall display a tab in the right sidebar (hereafter 'the right sidebar')
- it shall display in the right sidebart the list of all highlighted texts of the current note
- when clicking on an entry in the right sidebar, the cursor in the current note shall be moved to the position of the highlighted text

You can find the relevant documentation to develop Obsidian plugins at the following page:

- https://docs.obsidian.md/Home

_Here, several iterations to first make jumping to highlight works, than to have the content of the sidebar aligned on top_

---

- Write a new README (erase the old content) to briefly explain this plugin's functionnality

---

- Now, look for code simplification opportunities and make sure it follows security best practices

---

- Add a 2-clause BSD licence
