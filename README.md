# Highlights Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin adds a "Highlights" view to the right sidebar that lists every `==highlight==` found in the currently open markdown note. Selecting an entry focuses the note, scrolls to the highlighted text, and selects it so you can spot it instantly.

## Using the plugin

- Open any markdown note that contains text wrapped with `==double equals==`.
- The Highlights sidebar view shows all detected snippets along with their line numbers.
- Click an entry to jump straight to that highlight in the note.
